Since 2019, I have been studying as a PhD student at the Chemical and Petroleum Engineering, [University of Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca), supervised by Prof. [Shengnan Nancy Chen](https://schulich.ucalgary.ca/contacts/shengnan-nancy-chen). 

My research interests mainly lie in **application of machine learning for subsurface energy**, encompassing efficient algorithms and theoretical modelling for exploring the underground energy to unlock the production potential of unconventional oil and gas reservoirs. By applying cutting-edge technologies, I strive to revolutionize the industry's understanding and extraction of hydrocarbon resources.

In addition to my focus on unconventional reservoirs, I am deeply engaged in exploring the viability of **large-scale underground hydrogen storage (UHS)**. This research aligns with my vision of a decarbonized future, where sustainable energy solutions play a pivotal role in mitigating the effects of climate change. By investigating the feasibility and practicality of geological hydrogen storage, I aim to contribute to the advancement of clean energy technologies and facilitate the transition towards a greener and more sustainable energy landscape.  I also employ , **molecular dynamic simulation (MD)** to delve into fluid dynamics and adsorption phenomena within porous media at the nanoscale. By applying these advanced methods, we can gain a deeper understanding of the intricate processes taking place within porous structures.

My research interests include, but are not limited to:
* **Machine Learning Methods**: physics-informed machine learning, ensemble learning, features selection, hyperparameters optimization, etc. I am focusing on deriving the governing equation based on the data via integrating the automatic differention, sparse regression, fractional derivative.
* **Molecular Simulation**: adsorption, nanoflow, Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation.
* **Pore Network Modelling**: understand the macroscopic behavior of porous media by considering the microscopic interactions and geometry of the pore space. It allows for the prediction of properties like permeability, capillary pressure, and fluid displacement behavior in various porous materials.
